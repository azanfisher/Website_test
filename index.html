<h1 style="padding-top=50px;" id="aboutUs" padding-top="50px">About Us</h1>
<div class="aboutUs">
<p> Debrief is a covers band that live and operate in the Gloucestershire area and slightly beyond if the price is right.</p>
<p>We play a solid variety of songs across the decades but with a particular focus on rock music, both modern and classic. We also play some pop songs just to throw in the occasional crowd pleaser. You can find more about our typical setlist in the <em>Playlist</em> section below</p>
<p>We don't take ourselves too seriously, which is just as well if you've ever heard us, but we always try and make every gig a special occasion. So if you are looking to liven up your party, function or you need drunk people on the dancefloor of your evening do, then look no further!(or do, we won't mind).</p>
<p> Currently in the band (they're all expendable) are:</p>
<div id="bandBio">
<li><h2> Frank - Vocals and Guitar</h2></li>
<li><h2> John - Lead Guitar and Hair</h2></li>
<li><h2> Adam - Bass Guitar</h2></li>
<li><h2> Alex - Hits things</h2></li>
</div>

<h1>Our Origin Story</h1>
<p> Frank had purchased a small furry creature from a Signapore market stall where the old man advised him not to feed it after midnight. This was problematic for two reasons. 1) Frank doesn't listen and 2) Frank doesn't follow instructions. Well before you know it the small furry creature morphed into John</p>
<p>After swearing for a significant length of time (which apparently is completely normal for him), John picked up a guitar nearby and started widdling out an epic solo.</p>
<p>Sensing an opportunity, Frank also picked up another guitar and started to join in until John told him to pack it in. He spend the rest of the afternoon wailing into a microphone and the seeds of a moderately good local covers band was born.</p>
<p>Over time, Frank perfected the guitar but something was missing from this due. Both were too energetic and excitable. They needed a counterweight to their over-exuberent performance.</p>
<p>Step forward Adam. A bassist of no great distinction, he provided a solid lumbering anchor which helped weigh down the dynamic duo, transforming their performances at local open mic nights from "worryingly intesne" to "okay".</p>
<p>We don't actually know where Alex came from. He appeared one evening mid-way through a practice and it felt impolite to ask. A drummer of great distinction, he provided the comptence the band sorely needed.</p>
<p>Legend has it that if you say his name in the mirror three times at Midnight then he appears in the room and smashes out a 20 minute drum solo before killing you.</p>

<h1>Playlist/Songbook</h1>
<p>We enjoy playing a large range of rock and pop music spanning the decades. While we love playing well known rock anthems from a wide variety of bands, we also enjoy playing slightly obscure personal favourites to make ourselves stand out a bit from the rest of the crowd.</p>

<p>Check out our songbook and playlist set from Spotify below to see what we can currently play. It's a list that'll grow over time and we're more than happy to add to it with suggestions from yourselves if you'd like us to play at your party or venue. </p>
